- **Ansible** - Configuration management for installing dependencies.  
- **Jenkins** - CI/CD automation tool running in a containerized setup.  
- **GitHub** - Source code management and pipeline triggers.  
- **SonarCloud** - Code quality and security analysis.  
- **JFrog Artifactory** - Artifact storage and management.  
- **Maven** - Build tool for compiling and packaging applications.  

## Features  
- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment** using Terraform.  
- **Configuration Management** with Ansible.  
- **Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline** with GitHub Webhook integration.  
- **Static Code Analysis** via SonarCloud.  
- **Artifact Management** with JFrog Artifactory.
